# Git Protocol
Design and develop the Git protocol, distributed versioning control on a P2P network. Each peer can manage its projects (a set of files) using the Git protocol (a minimal version).

The system allows the users to create a new repository in a specific folder, add new files to be tracked by the system, apply the changing on the local repository (commit function), push the networkâ€™s changes, and pull the changing from the network.

The git protocol has lot-specific behavior to manage the conflicts; in this version, it is only required that if there are some conflicts, the systems can download the remote copy, and the merge is manually done. As described in the [GitProtocol Java API](https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/distributedsystems-unisa/blob/master/homework/GitProtocol.java).
